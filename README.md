# INTRODUCTION

This repo contains my course project 1 on Coursera "exploratory data analysis"

Inside the folder are: 

*  4 R code (plot1.R through plot4.R) script which contains the functions I executed on the assignment
*  4 PNG files (png1 through png4) which are the graphs of data plotted using each of the codes respectively
*  This Readme.md file which describes the assignment and how the scripts work, and
*  CodeBook.md which contains the details of the codes in the assignment.

#  ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

*  The assignment involoves loading data entry from the UC Irvine Marchine Learnng Repository ("the individual household
electric power consumption dataset")
*  tidying the data to make it a bit more easy to analyse
*  plotting 4 graphs of the data using the 4 R code scripts and storing the output in a file device (png format).

#  HOW THIS SCRIPT WORKS

*  clone this repo to a local file
*  open Rstudio and source the each of the R code script,  setting the working directory to the 
   file containing the unzipped dataset
*  run each of the script in the console
*  each script should generate each of the png files included in this folder.

I still have difficulty loading segments of data into R. My method was crude and rudimentary, I am working on 
improving it. Any suggestion and contribution will be highly appreciated. 

Looking forward to your feedback!
